<h5>Description</h5>

This web app serves as a platform for interaction between common citizens and NGOs or Social activists. We have developed a medium for users to alert us about the location and conditions of homeless people. Users can choose to register themselves as a volunteer or under any NGO organisation. We have added user to user authentication where other users of this service can verify the integrity of any report made on the site. If a report gets more than n number of verifications then it is our responsibility to notify the nearby NGOs about the homeless. We have a donation portal so volunteers can make any contributions to the NGO organisation of their choice.
This website is completely mobile responsive for user's convenience.

<h5> Technology Stack </h5>

ReactJs, Node, Material-UI, Mongodb, JSX, ES6, HTML, CSS

<h5> Issues Encountered <h5/>

We tried to implement Google maps geolocation API to get the live location of user in the step or alerting us about any homeless person's location but we ran into some bugs and finally we had to drop the idea because of the limited 7 hour time constraint and the fact that we had to pay to get the API access
